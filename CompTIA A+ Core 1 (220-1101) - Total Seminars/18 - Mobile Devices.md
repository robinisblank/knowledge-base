# Mobile Devices

## What is a Mobile Device?
- A mobile device is normally a single sealed unit with fixed components. This is why they are not easily serviceable and are not designed to be upgraded.
- A mobile device runs on mobile OSes like Android and iOS.
- Mobile devices have multiple wireless connections.
- Smartphones, tablets, wearables, and Global Positioning System (GPS) are all examples of mobile devices.
- Credit card reader also comes as a smartphone accessory.
- Micro/mini SD cards add storage to your mobile devices.

## Mobile Connections
- Mobile devices use wired or wireless connections.
- Wired connections include micro-USB, mini-USB, USB-C, Lightning, and Thunderbolt.
- Today, USB-C, micro-USB, and Lightning are the most common.
- Wireless connections include Near Field Communication (NFC), Bluetooth, 802.11 (Wi-Fi), and Infrared (IR) in old devices.
- NFC requires extremely close proximity to function. That's why it says "tap-to-print" or "tap-to-pay".
- Bluetooth devices like speakers don't require a PIN while pairing because it's not a security issue. But when you are pairing two smartphones, then they can transfer files and do many things that can risk security. That's why it requires a PIN while pairing.
- Bluetooth and Wi-Fi create a profile after connection, and this profile information can change with time. So, if you face any problem connecting, delete the profile and pair/connect again.
- The device should be in the line of sight of infrared. It's a low-speed connection.
- Tethering and Hotspot allow other device(s) to have Internet connectivity through your mobile's cellular network.
- Tethering requires a wired connection, so only one device can connect at a time.
- Hotspot is wireless and provides an SSID that multiple devices can connect to.
- Airplane mode turns off anything that makes radio frequencies (e.g., 802.11, NFC, and Bluetooth).

## Touring Android
- No notes needed.

## Virtual Reality
- Virtual Reality (VR) is a complete virtualized environment.
- VR will include a headset that detects head movements (tracking).
- Augmented Reality (AR) places virtual objects in the real world.
