# Portable Computing

## Laptop Features
- Portable computers have a function (Fn) key to activate alternative options.
- The function keys on the keyboard enable users to do things like change the brightness and contrast of the screen, change the speaker volume, and toggle to an external monitor.
- Use Settings in Windows to control many aspects of portable computers.
- Physical laptop lock and cable lock are used to secure a laptop in a public space. For this, the laptop should have a locking port.
- Docking stations and port replicators allow a laptop to connect to various peripherals and expand its functionality without using built-in ports and creating a wiring mess.
- Do not get tricked by questions where the word "laptop" has nothing to do with the problem.
- There will be questions where the solution to the problem is to turn Wi-Fi/Bluetooth on with a button even though nowadays there are no separate buttons. Instead, we have a function key that turns everything off via airplane mode. So, be careful.

## Laptop Hardware Troubleshooting - The Tools
- Laptops are all different from the inside. They have hundreds of tiny screws, single and double-sided tapes, tiny weak connectors, etc. So, take your time and be careful when dealing with the inside of a laptop.
- Start laptop repair by reviewing the manufacturer's online information like maintenance and service guide.
- Standardized parts like HDDs, SSDs, and RAM can be bought from any computer parts store or website.
- Specialized parts like cases, screens, and touchpads must be bought from manufacturers or third-party sites like eBay.
- Use caution on screws and connections; take pictures of the disassembly process.
- You can use a piece of tape to stick screws on while disassembling the laptop so that they are organized and in order.
- Keeping all hardware and components in a single container can make small parts tough to find and identify when reassembling the computer.
- The battery should be removed or disconnected to avoid short circuits while working inside the computer.
- Avoid using tools that are not specifically designed to perform disassembly tasks.

## Laptop Hardware - Core Hardware
- Commonly replaced laptop parts include laptop batteries, hard drives, RAM, CMOS batteries, wireless cards, Bluetooth modules, and optical drives.
- Be sure to refer to the manufacturer's website for information regarding disassembling.
- Search third-party sites like eBay for discount prices on core laptop hardware.

## Laptop Hardware - CPU and Motherboard
