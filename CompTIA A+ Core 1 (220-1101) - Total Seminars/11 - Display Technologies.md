# Display Technologies

## Monitor Technologies
- A monitor comprises a mosaic of individual picture elements (pixels); the total pixels across and down is the resolution.
- A pixel consists of three elements that emit red, green, and blue light. Each element has a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) with a colored film. Liquid crystals can let light pass when given electricity, and block it when electricity is removed. Different opacity levels can also be achieved.
- First generations LCDs used Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp (CCFL) as backlight. But today, LCDs use Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs). These lights shine through the liquid crystals.
- Twisted Nematic (TN) and In-Plane Switching (IPS) are different LCD panel technologies.
- Nit (nt) is used to measure the brightness of electronic displays.
- Panels generally run from 200-500 nits.
- Response time is the time it takes one pixel to go from all black to white and back to black again. Panels need to have a good response time so that we humans can detect motion on screen.
- Panel response times run from about 1ms - 4ms.
- When someone says that they are selling an LED monitor, they're selling an LCD monitor with LEDs as backlight.
- Organic LED (OLED) doesn't use a backlight, as the pixels make their own light.
- You can have thinner screens with OLED.
- Digital Light Processing (DLP) uses a grid of tiny mirrors that shine through a color wheel to create an image.

## LCD Breakdown
- The back panel (backlight unit) distributes the light emanating from the CCFL tubes or LED evenly across the display so that there are no bright or dark spots.
- Inverters convert DC power back into AC power for fluorescent lights.
- Only CCFL screens need inverters.
- LCDs consist of a panel, backlight unit, connectors, input from a data connection, and power connection.

## Graphics Cards and Connections
- Back in the day, a portion of RAM was used to store the color data of each pixel before displaying them on screen and this process is known as frame buffering. But today, there are processors that instead of telling the video card the color of each pixel one by one, can tell it to display a circle or anything.
- Graphics cards (aka video cards) consists of a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and a dedicated memory (VRAM) to handle high-resolution displays and store repeated elements.
- The GPU refreshes the monitor's image at least 60 times per second, often faster.
- Popular GPU manufacturers are Nvidia, AMD (which owns ATI), and Intel.
- Most motherboards have High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) soldered onto them. This is because many CPUs these days have integrated (built-in) GPUs.
- AMD's CPUs with built-in GPUs are called APUs (Accelerated Processing Units).
- Video Graphics Array (VGA) is an older, analog connection standard with 15 pins.
- Digital Visual Interface (DVI) was the first popular digital connector.
- DVI-I (digital and analog) has a plus with four dots.
- DVI-D (only digital) has a minus.
- DVI-I can be adapted to VGA by using a DVI-to-VGA adapter, but DVI-D cannot. This is why there is a plus or minus to prevent you from putting the wrong connector.
- DVI comes in single-link (lower resolutions) and dual-link (higher resolutions).
- Single-link has space between pins, but dual-link doesn't.
- HDMI is a popular connector that handles both video and audio. It is commonly used in consumer electronics for its ease of use. It also supports Digital Rights Management (DRM).
- There is a regular HDMI and Mini-HDMI connector.
- DisplayPort is a newer high-performance connector for high-end video cards, designed to support high resolutions and multiple monitors. It is seen as a competitor to HDMI. It is used primarily for video, with regular DisplayPort and Mini DisplayPort connectors.
- High-end graphics cards often include multiple connection options (DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort) for compatibility with various monitors.
- Graphics cards may default to output through a specific port, so users need to check and adjust settings accordingly.

## Resolutions and Aspect Ratios
- Higher resolution monitors have more pixels, and more pixels define clearer images.
- First-generation monitors had a 4:3 aspect ratio just like the TVs at that time.
- In the category of 4:3 aspect ratio, we have VGA (display standard) (640x480 pixels resolution), SVGA (800x600 pixels), SXGA (1280x1024 pixels), and UXGA (1600x1200 pixels).
- Most versions of Windows will downgrade to SVGA so that they can run if they are having problems with the video card.
- SXGA has a 5:4 aspect ratio, but we count it with a 4:3 aspect ratio only.
- The 16:10 aspect ratio was very popular, as it was tied into the golden ratio. In this category, we have WSXGA (1440x900 pixels) and WUXGA (1920x1200 pixels).
- A lot of laptops used WSXGA.
- Black bars adjust your monitor to display the aspect ratio that doesn't fit.
- 720p also known as HD (High Definition) has a resolution of 1280x720 pixels. The "p" stands for progressive scan, meaning all lines of the image are drawn in sequence. It wasn't really 1280x720, it was 1366x768. Another resolution is QHD or WQHD with 2560x1440 pixels which is double of 720p.
- 1080p also known as Full HD (FHD) has a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels. This is one of the most common monitor resolutions today.
- 4K also known as Ultra HD (UHD) has a resolution of 3840x2160 pixels, offering four times the pixels of 1080p.
- 5k offers a resolution of 5120x2880 pixels.

## Installing a Graphics Card
- Graphics cards may default to output through a specific port, so users need to check and adjust settings accordingly.
- Almost all graphics cards use 16-lane PCIe slots and one or two PCIe power connectors.
- With multiple graphics cards, you can define the primary card in the system setup. IGFX refers to the integrated graphics.
- Having multiple monitors or mining cryptocurrency are common reasons for having multiple graphics cards.
- A riser card extends or repositions motherboard expansion slots, allowing additional hardware in space-constrained setups. These could range from graphics cards, sound cards, to network cards.
- Always run the system at your monitor's native resolution.
- Adjusting font size, updating drivers, and setting the resolution to native are some tasks that are performed as part of video card installation.

## Multiple Monitors
- You don't need to have a special video card. You don't need to plug them into a single video card. You can connect each monitor with a separate graphics card. The resolution and size of the monitors can be different.
- Windows multi-monitor support is not dependent on a single graphics card or even the same resolution.
- Make sure you recognize your primary (number 1) monitor since it's your main display by default.
- Second monitors can duplicate or extend the desktop.
- The number of monitors you can plug in depends on your graphics card, the available ports, and the capabilities of your system.

## Projectors
- Projectors have resolutions and aspect ratios just like monitors.
- They usually have either DLP or LCD technology.
- The light source can be a bulb or LED. LED ones are better as bulbs can go out.
- Get a projector with a bulb that lasts long. LED ones are recommended.
- Lumens define the brightness of the projector.
- The farther your projector is the bigger the screen is, and the closer you get the smaller the screen gets. This is known as throw.
- Every projector has a minimum and a maximum throw distance. You can adjust it or get replaceable lenses.
- Pincushion, keystone, and skew are geometric adjustments you will deal with.

## Troubleshooting Display Technologies
- Intermittent projector shutdowns are caused by overheating; clean the inside of the projector.
- Burned-out bulbs happen with projectors. Bulbs need replacing from time to time and can be expensive.
- Make sure the correct input source is selected to display content to avoid incorrect data source issues.
- Nightlight setting reduces blue light at night to ease eye strain.
- Cable issues can be caused by bent or broken pins in VGA cables can cause color/display problems; less common with HDMI, DVI, or DisplayPort cables.
- Image/display burn-in was common with CRT monitors but rare in modern displays.
- Dead pixel(s) is a physical defect; the monitor should be repaired or replaced.
- Color or brightness issues can be adjusted in display settings.
- Flashing screen is caused by cable incompatibility, such as using a low-speed HDMI cable in a high-speed environment.
