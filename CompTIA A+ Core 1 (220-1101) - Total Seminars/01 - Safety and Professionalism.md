## Troubleshooting Theory
- Always consider corporate policies, procedures, and impacts before doing changes.
- **Step 1**: Identify the problem.
- **Step 2**: Establish a theory of probable cause (question the obvious).
- **Step 3**: Test the theory to determine cause. If theory isn't confirmed, re-establish a new theory. Escalate the issue, if necessary.
- **Step 4**: Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution.
- **Step 5**: Verify full system functionality, and implement preventative measures.
- **Step 6**: Document findings, actions, and outcomes.
