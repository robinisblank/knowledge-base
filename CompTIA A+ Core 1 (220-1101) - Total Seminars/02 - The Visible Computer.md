# The Visible Computer

## Primary PC Components
- System unit contains motherboard, CPU, RAM, and hard drives. Every other device is a peripheral.
- Monitors provide visual output and webcams provide visual input.
- Keyboard, mouse, and game controller are input devices.
- Printer gives paper output.
- Speakers and headsets provide audio output.
- External hard drive provides portable storage.
- Microphones provide audio input.

## Touring a PC
- Knowing each component and connector will make you a better technician.
- Components such as USB and audio connectors use unique colors to make it easier to identify the generation.
- Open case (aka open-air frame)
- Closed case (traditional PC build)
- Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
- Random Access Memory (RAM)
- Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) mat (aka antistatic mat) protects components from electrical damage.
- Mini DIN (PS/2)
- Universal Serial Bus (USB)
- USB Type-C
- High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI)
- Wi-Fi antenna connectors
- Audio connectors
- Input/Output (I/O) shield
- Video Graphics Array (VGA)
- Digital Visual Interface (DVI)
- RJ-45
- S-Video
- Expansion slot

## What is a Computer?
- A computer gets work or play done.
- A computer has a CPU, RAM, mass storage, and an OS.
- Laptops, mobile devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) are all computers.
- Mass storage stores programs and the data that we save.
- CPU gives instructions to other components and monitors the peripherals.
- A copy of the program is made onto the RAM when it is running. RAM is much faster than the mass storage, but not as fast as the CPU. RAM is much more expensive, and that's why we only use it when running programs.
- Whatever work we have done remains on the RAM until we press save. Our data gets copied and saved onto the mass storage after we press save.
- An Operating System (OS) is the king of all programs. It is used to interact with the computer and run other programs.
