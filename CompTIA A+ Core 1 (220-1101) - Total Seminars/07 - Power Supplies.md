# Power Supplies

## The Power Supply
- PSU stands for Power Supply unit.
- Power supplies are step-down transformers that convert AC power from the wall outlet to DC power for the computer.
- Older power supplies had a slider to select the input voltage according to your region. For example, 115V is standard voltage in North America and 230V is standard voltage in most parts of the world. Modern power supplies have auto-sensing feature that can detect and adjust to the input voltage automatically.
- Original ATX power supplies had a 20-pin main power connector. Modern power supplies need more power, so a 4-pin P4 connector was added.
- There are three main types of power that power supplies provide:
	1. 12 volts (yellow wire)
	2. 5 volts (red wire)
	3. 3.3 volts (orange wire)
- The ATX12V standard evolved from the original ATX specification because of the increasing power demands of more advanced hardware.
- The main power connectors for the motherboard are the 20-pin ATX and the 4-pin P4.
- Molex, SATA, and PCIe connectors are for peripherals, drives, and video cards.
- Modular power supply has no cables coming off of it. It has many connectors in which you can insert only cables that you need.

## Choosing a Power Supply
- Only a certain percentage of AC power is converted into DC power. Electricity is lost because of heat, friction, and many other factors that affect efficiency.
- All PSUs have a wattage rating which means that it can provide up to this much watts.
- Some websites will help you determine the wattage you need based on the hardware components you are using.
- Buy a PSU with a little more wattage than your system needs.
- Shop for higher-efficiency power supplies.
- You only need the highest watt output when using your system at its max.
- 80 Plus rating system is a life saver as it helps us choose high efficiency PSUs easily.
- There are rankings in 80 Plus rating system like, Gold, Platinum, and Titanium.
- Modular PSUs have connectors, and solder (non-modular) PSUs have cables.
- The standard ATX size PSU covers most systems. They also fit in the smaller form factor systems. You can also find a small ATX PSU for a smaller system.
- A Flex power supply is a small-form-factor power supply.
- Most power supplies will still operate acceptably down to around +/-11 VDC.

## Cooling Your System
- You can maximize the airflow in your PC by practicing proper cable management and regular cleanings.
- The purpose of fans is to intake cool air and exhaust hot air.
- Usually, we put fans at the bottom and front to intake cool air and fans at the back and top to exhaust hot air.
- Use compressed/canned air or a PC blower instead of a vacuum cleaner when cleaning out a PC. PC blowers don't produce any electrostatic discharge.
- System Setup may have custom fan settings and temperature alerts.

## Installing and Troubleshooting a PSU
- Practice proper power handling.
- Motherboard power connectors have unique shapes to help orient the power cable.
- Power supply tester is a device used to test whether a PSU is working properly.
- Always double check cable connections when building your PC.
- If a PSU has died out, your system will not boot up and the PSU fan will not spin.
- PSU problems can present themselves in a variety of ways ranging from random rebooting to complete system lockups.
- The multimeter is the tool used to see the proper voltages coming from the PSU and into the motherboard. It should read 12v, 5v, and 3.3v.
- The anti-static wrist strap is one tools you would actually never want to use around troubleshooting a power supply issue. The last thing you want to do is ground yourself when working around electricity!
