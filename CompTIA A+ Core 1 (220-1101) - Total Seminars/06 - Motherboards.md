# Motherboards

## Form Factors
- Form factors are standards that define the physical dimensions, shape, mounting hole locations, power supply type, and overall specifications of a motherboard.
- They ensure compatibility between motherboards, cases, and other components.
- ATX, microATX, and Mini-ITX are common form factors.
- ATX stands for Advanced Technology eXtended, and ITX stands for Information Technology eXtended.
- ATX is of 12 in x 9.6 in, microATX is of 9.6 in x 9.6 in, and Mini-ITX is of 6.7 in x 6.7 in.

## Chipsets
- In the past, motherboards had many chips, each specialized in doing a single task. But now we have chipsets that combine functions from many single-function chips.
- Early chipsets offered Northbridge and Southbridge that worked together. Northbridge handled fast stuff like memory, and Southbridge handled slower stuff like hard drives.
- Modern chipsets feature Southbridge, and the CPU handles Northbridge functions.
- Chipsets define, RAM capacity, video cards, USB capabilities, and much more.
- When you are buying a motherboard, you are essentially buying a chipset.
- A CPU can support different kind of chipsets. Choosing the right chipset according to your needs makes a difference.

## Choosing the Right Motherboard
- Motherboards are also referred to as mainboards, system boards, backplane boards, and mobos.
- Consider motherboard compatibility: Is it for a desktop or a laptop? Does it need to be multi socket like for a server?
- Type of CPU (LGA or PGA), form factor, and extra RAM capacity are all important considerations when choosing a motherboard.
- When selecting a motherboard, consider its intended use.

## Installing and Troubleshooting a Motherboard
- ESD strap is a device that grounds a person working with electrical components. It prevents buildup of static electricity that causes electrostatic discharge.
- Standoffs are the screws used to keep the motherboard from touching the case so that there isn't an electric short, which could damage the components.
- I/O shields are custom-made to fit the motherboard's I/O area. They protect internal components form dust and Electromagnetic Interference (EMI).
- Installing the CPU and heat sink prior to installing the motherboard makes the build process much easier.
- If you encounter capacitor swelling or burning smell, immediately remove the power and stop using that defective motherboard.
- SATA cables attach to connectors on the motherboard, but they are not part of the motherboard. PCIe slots, voltage regulators, and power connectors are all found on motherboards.
