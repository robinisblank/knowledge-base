# Essential Peripherals

## Understanding USB
- Same lecture as in [/CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1101) - Total Seminars/10 - Essential Peripherals](/CompTIA%20A+%20Core%201%20(220-1101)%20-%20Total%20Seminars/10%20-%20Essential%20Peripherals.md)
- All USB devices connect to built-in USB controllers, which are in charge of all connected USB devices.
- USB Type-A is generally a downstream connection; USB Type-B is generally an upstream connection.
- The motherboard sends commands downstream, and the device takes commands from upstream.
- In most cases, B connector is soldered into the device.
- B connectors are plugged into the devices. You never plug them in a computer.
- USB Type-C automatically configures the upstream and downstream connections. You can plug it either way.
- Typically, multiple controllers (like 2.0 or 3.1) are connected to separate root hubs. The connectors coming off of the root hub are colored according to the controller connected to it.
- USB allows you to plug in up to 127 devices.
- A USB hub lets you connect multiple devices using a single connector on the motherboard.
- A single connector cannot supply enough power if many devices are connected to the USB hub. There are powered hubs that have AC connectors to plug into the AC power.
- In Windows, you can see USB controllers in Device Manager.

## Webcams and Videoconferencing
- Same lecture as in [/CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1101) - Total Seminars/10 - Essential Peripherals](/CompTIA%20A+%20Core%201%20(220-1101)%20-%20Total%20Seminars/10%20-%20Essential%20Peripherals.md)
- Webcams enable us to meet remotely using videoconferencing software.
- Two common videoconferencing software are Zoom and Microsoft Teams.
