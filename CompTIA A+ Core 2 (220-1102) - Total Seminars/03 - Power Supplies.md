# Power Supplies

## Power Protection
- Electricity from the power company can be imperfect. You don't always get that perfect sine wave.
- Sag/brownout refers to intentional or unintentional short-term voltage dip.
- Spike/surge refers to more voltage than what you're expecting.
- Sags can reboot our computer, and spikes can destroy our systems.
- Surge protector/suppressor protects against spikes.
- Surge suppressors are also available for Ethernet cables, landlines, and USBs.
- A cheap surge suppressor will only work fine once. You can have one with a trip alert so that you know if a spike happened.
- Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) protects against both spikes and sags.
- UPSes provide backup battery power.
- When the power fails, UPSes can keep your system running long enough to power them down. They cannot run your system for hours.
- Many UPSes come with a software interface between the UPS and your system so that you can monitor it.
- A power supply has a built-in surge suppressor. They can suppress spikes but cannot protect from sags.
