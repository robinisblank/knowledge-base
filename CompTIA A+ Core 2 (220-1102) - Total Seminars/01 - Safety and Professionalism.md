# Safety and Professionalism

## Professional Communication, Part 1
- Be on time. Contact the customer if you are going to be late.
- Actively listen and avoid interrupting the customer. Step in and drag the conversation to the problem if the customer deviates from it. Take notes if necessary.
- Clarify customer statements. Ask open-ended questions to narrow down the scope and zero into the problem. Ignore your biases and don't just jump into solving the problem.
- Maintain a positive attitude and project confidence, especially when correcting customers.
- Use proper and plain language. Avoid jargon, acronyms, and slang.
- After listening and talking to customers properly, it's time to discuss cost.
- Set and meet expectations/timelines and communicate status with customers.

## Professional Communication, Part 2
- Be culturally sensitive, use appropriate professional titles, and always be nice to people regardless of their differences.
- Avoid distractions when working with a customer. Avoid texting, personal calls, social media, talking to co-workers, etc., and give all your attention to them.
- Avoid being judgmental. We might have seen the same issue thousands of times, but it's their first time facing it, and we need to take their concerns seriously.
- Avoid dismissing customer problems. What might seem small to us might seem critical to them.
- Deal appropriately with customers' confidential and private materials. You could get into trouble if sensitive information like passwords or photographs gets leaked.
- Never argue with customers or be defensive.
- Follow up with customer later to verify satisfaction.
- Provide proper documentation on services provided.
- Offer different repair/replacement options.
