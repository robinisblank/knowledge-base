## Boot Order
- When a system boots, it looks for a bootable device.
- It's important to make sure the system looks for the correct boot devices.
- The boot order is defined in the system setup.
- A computer cannot boot from a non-bootable device or media.
- A computer will only boot if the bootable device contains a working, properly-created bootable drive image.
